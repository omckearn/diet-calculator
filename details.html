      <h2>The Scoring Algorithm (and Items Not Included)</h2>
      <h3>What the Health Score Measures</h3>
      <p>
        The Diet-Health-Environment Calculator provides a good gauge of a person’s diet’s impact
        on their health and the environment. It is adapted from a 13-item Rapid Prime Diet Quality
        Score Screener (rPDQS) developed by Selma Kronsteiner-Gicevic and her colleagues and
        validated against the Healthy Eating Index.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our calculator is based on only 16 dietary habits and cannot cover every detail about every
        individual’s diet. Restaurant meals are particularly challenging because they vary from
        healthy salads to voluminous, fatty, salty meals with few vegetables or fruit at table-service
        eateries. Restaurant scores are based on estimated saturated-fat content. Also tough to
        evaluate are stews, casseroles, and other mixed dishes in which the ingredients could vary
        tremendously; the algorithm assigns the typical ingredients and nutrients to the various
        food categories. For restaurant meals and mixed dishes, users of the algorithm could adjust
        the numbers of servings they consume based on their estimates of the amounts of key
        ingredients.
      </p>
      <p>
        Low-fat or fat-free dairy foods are lower in saturated fat and healthier for consumers than
        their full-fat versions. However, low-fat yogurt and cheese are fermented and may be less
        beneficial than once thought. Still, milkfat adds calories unneeded by most people and does
        not provide any benefits. The health benefit of low-fat dairy products to society at large is
        minimal because the removed milkfat will be consumed in the form of butter, ice cream, or
        other foods.
      </p>
      <h3>What the Environment Score Measures</h3>
      <p>
        Environmental scores, not included in the rPDQS, are based on per-kilogram amounts of
        food and the associated amounts of greenhouse gas emissions (35%), stress-weighted
        water use (25%), eutrophying emissions (15%), land use (15%), and acidifying emissions
        (10%). The best way to get a good Environment score is to eat less (or no!) food, but doing
        that could mean eating fewer healthy foods, thereby holding down the Health score.
      </p>
      <h3>What This Calculator Does Not Include</h3>
      <p>
        The following factors are not included in the scoring algorithm and deserve a few words of
        explanation.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Salt/sodium: Diets high in sodium cause as many as 100,000 premature deaths
          annually, but because salt is used so widely throughout the food supply, with
          amounts varying from brand to brand and with people adding salt to some meals, it
          is impossible to estimate accurately how much sodium people are consuming. Two
          major sources of sodium: bread, pizza crust, tortillas (because most people eat many
          grain products in a day) and table-service restaurant meals (because portions are
          often huge, highly salted, and contain cheese, processed meat, and dressings and
          sauces that are high in sodium).
        </li>
        <li>
          Organic foods: Organically produced vegetables, meat, eggs, and other foods are a
          great benefit to farmers and farm workers because they minimize exposure to
          synthetic pesticides and antibiotics. Consumers may benefit from lower residues of
          pesticides in their food and fewer antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The environmental
          impacts are mixed. Insecticides may kill beneficial insects and reduce the food
          supply available for birds and other animals, and herbicides may reduce weed
          populations that otherwise provide food and shelter for insects, birds, and small
          mammals. However, crop yields are generally lower for organic crops, meaning that
          it takes more land to produce the same amount of food (including organic meat,
          which typically comes from animals that consumed organically raised crops).
        </li>
        <li>
          Animal welfare: Pigs raised outside of cages, broiler chickens not confined to huge
          windowless warehouses, layer hens not crammed into tiny cages, and cattle raised
          on pastureland for their entire lives instead of being “finished” at feedlots provides
          major benefits to the animals. Note, though, that grass-fed cattle take longer to
          mature and therefore emit larger quantities of methane, a potent greenhouse gas,
          than feedlot cattle. Also, because of their greater need for pastureland, grass-fed
          (and regeneratively raised) cattle—especially with their higher cost, tougher
          meat—will inevitably comprise only a small fraction of the beef Americans
          consume.
        </li>
        <li>
          Food waste: Roughly one-third of all food produced is wasted. That includes crops
          left on farms; spoilage at packinghouses, factories, and supermarkets; and uneaten
          food in homes. And that includes perfectly healthful and edible produce that is
          discarded because of blemishes and packaged foods that passed their “best by”
          dates even though they were still perfectly edible. Reducing food waste could reduce
          the amount of food that needs to be produced and the food and packaging dumped
          in landfills. Everyone could help reduce food waste.
        </li>
        <li>
          Genetically modified (GE) ingredients: Countless packaged foods contain
          ingredients derived from wheat, corn, and soy crops grown from seeds that were
          modified to resist the effects of herbicides or to contain a harmless insecticide.
          Hawaiian papayas have been modified to resist a crop-killing virus, and tiny
          percentages of potatoes and apples have been modified to resist browning when
          sliced. The oils, starches, and other common ingredients made from GE crops have
          been so purified that they do not contain any modified genetic material. There is no
          evidence that foods containing ingredients from GE crops have harmed anyone’s
          health though some evidence indicates that glyphosate, the key ingredient in
          Roundup herbicide used on GE corn, soybeans, canola, and sugar beets, is
          carcinogenic. GE crops have both positive (e.g., reduced use of toxic pesticides) and
          negative (e.g., herbicide-resistant weeds and insecticide-resistant insects)
          environmental consequences.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On all those issues, people can “vote” their preferences when they shop. People can also
        support local, state, and federal legislation and vote for representatives that support
        reducing pesticide/fertilizer use, improving animal welfare, improving food labeling, and
        other measures.
