      <h2>The Scoring Algorithm (and Items Not Included)</h2>
      <h3>What the Health Score Measures</h3>
      <p>
        The Diet-Health-Environment Calculator provides a good gauge of a person’s diet’s impact
        on their health and the environment. It is adapted from a 13-item Rapid Prime Diet Quality
        Score Screener (rPDQS) developed by Selma Kronsteiner-Gicevic and her colleagues and
        validated against the Healthy Eating Index.
      </p>
      <p>
        A high Health Score indicates a lower risk of a serious chronic disease, including obesity,
        type 2 diabetes, numerous cancers, heart attacks, and strokes. Consuming plenty of beans,
        nuts, vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy foods, and non-fried poultry will give
        you a high score. On the other hand, diets rich in meat, full-fat dairy products, sugar drinks,
        desserts, and alcoholic beverages result in lower scores. In terms of nutrients, it’s best to
        choose foods low in sodium, added sugars, saturated fat, and alcohol and high in dietary
        fiber (found only in plants).
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Calculator is based on only 16 dietary habits and cannot cover every detail of an
        individual’s diet. Restaurant meals are particularly challenging because they vary from
        small, healthy salads to voluminous, fatty, salty multi-course meals with few vegetables or
        fruit. Restaurant scores are based on estimated saturated-fat content. Also tough to
        evaluate are stews, casseroles, and other mixed dishes in which the ingredients could vary
        tremendously; the algorithm assigns the typical ingredients and nutrients to the various
        food categories. Users of the Calculator could adjust the numbers of servings they consume
        if their servings are particularly small or large. Low-fat or fat-free dairy foods are lower in
        saturated fat and healthier for consumers than their full-fat versions. However, higher-fat
        versions of yogurt and cheese are fermented and may be less unhealthy than once thought.
        Still, milkfat adds calories that most people don’t need.
      </p>
      <h3>What the Environment Score Measures</h3>
      <p>
        Environmental scores, not included in the rPDQS, are based on per-kilogram amounts of
        food and the associated amounts of greenhouse gas emissions (35%), stress-weighted
        water use (25%), eutrophying emissions (15%), land use (15%), and acidifying emissions
        (10%). The best way to get a good Environment Score is to eat less (or no!) food, but doing
        that could mean eating fewer healthy foods, thereby holding down the Health Score.
      </p>
      <h3>What This Calculator Does Not Consider</h3>
      <p>
        Some of the factors not included in the scoring algorithm deserve a few words of
        explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Salt/sodium:</strong> Diets high in sodium cause as many as 100,000 premature deaths
        annually, but because salt is used so widely throughout the food supply, with amounts
        varying from brand to brand and with people adding salt to some meals, it is impossible to
        estimate accurately how much sodium people are consuming. Two major sources of sodium:
        bread, pizza crust, tortillas (because most people eat many grain products in a day) and
        table-service restaurant meals (because portions are often huge, highly salted, and contain
        cheese, processed meat, and dressings and sauces that are high in sodium).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Organic foods:</strong> Organically produced vegetables, meat, eggs, and other foods are a
        great benefit to farmers and farm workers because they minimize exposure to synthetic
        pesticides and antibiotics. Consumers may benefit from lower residues of pesticides in
        their food and fewer antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The environmental impacts are mixed.
        Insecticides may kill beneficial insects and reduce the food supply available for birds and
        other animals, and herbicides may reduce weed populations that otherwise provide food and
        shelter for insects, birds, and small mammals. However, crop yields are generally lower for
        organic crops, meaning that it takes more land to produce the same amount of food.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Animal welfare:</strong> Pigs not raised in cages, broiler chickens not confined to huge
        windowless warehouses, layer hens not crammed into tiny cages, and cattle raised on
        pastureland for their entire lives instead of being “finished” at feedlots are hugely beneficial
        to the animals. Note, though, that grass-fed cattle take longer to mature and therefore emit
        larger quantities of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, than feedlot cattle. Also, because of
        their greater need for pastureland, grass-fed cattle—with their higher cost and tougher
        meat—will inevitably comprise only a small fraction of the beef Americans consume.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Food waste:</strong> Roughly one-third of all food produced is wasted. That includes crops
        left on farms; spoilage at packinghouses, factories, and supermarkets; and uneaten food in
        homes. And that includes perfectly healthful and edible produce that is discarded because
        of blemishes and packaged foods that passed their “best by” dates even though they were
        still perfectly edible. Reducing food waste could reduce the amount of food that needs to be
        produced and the food and packaging dumped in landfills.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Genetically modified (GE) ingredients:</strong> Countless packaged foods contain
        ingredients derived from wheat, corn, and soy crops grown from seeds that were modified
        to resist the effects of herbicides or to contain a harmless insecticide. Hawaiian papayas
        have been modified to resist a crop-killing virus, and tiny percentages of potatoes and
        apples have been modified to resist browning when sliced. The oils, starches, and other
        common ingredients made from GE crops have been so purified that they do not contain any
        modified genetic material. There is no evidence that foods containing ingredients from GE
        crops have harmed anyone’s health though some evidence indicates that glyphosate, the
        key ingredient in Roundup herbicide used on GE corn, soybeans, canola, and other crops, is
        carcinogenic. GE crops have both positive (e.g., reduced use of toxic pesticides) and
        negative (e.g., herbicide-resistant weeds and insecticide-resistant insects) environmental
        consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        On all those issues, people can “vote” their preferences when they shop. People can also
        support local, state, and federal legislation and vote for representatives that support
        reducing pesticide/fertilizer use, improving animal welfare, improving food labeling, and
        other measures.
