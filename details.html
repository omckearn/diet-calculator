      <h2>What the scores mean</h2>
      <p>
        Each food category has two numbers: a Health score and an Environment score.
        The Health score uses a 0–2 scale, while the Environment score reflects impact on a 0–2 scale
        with one decimal. Your totals are the sum across all 16 categories.
      </p>

        <h3>Health score</h3>
        <p>
          Higher points reflect foods linked with better dietary outcomes.
          The stoplight colors map to low (red), medium (yellow), and high (green) scores.

      <article class="details-card">
        <h3>Environment score</h3>
        <p>
          Higher points indicate a lower environmental footprint. Small differences are shown with
          a single decimal so the scale stays sensitive to food choices.
        </p>

      <article class="details-card">
        <h3>Why frequency matters</h3>
        <p>
          The frequency options are ordered from least to most, so your selection determines how
          many points that category contributes to each total.
